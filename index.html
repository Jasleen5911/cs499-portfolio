  <h1>CS 499 ePortfolio – Jasleen Kaur</h1>
<!-- About -->
  <section>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU has helped me grow as a developer and better understand the software development lifecycle. Through this capstone, I created a professional ePortfolio that highlights my progress and skills, especially in full stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose to enhance a Contact Management System I previously built in CS320 Software Design and Engineering, replacing the original Java-based system with a full-stack React and Node.js application. I focused on creating a clean interface and reusable components. For algorithms and data structures, I added dynamic filtering and sorting, allowing users to search and organize contacts efficiently. For Databases, I implemented a MongoDB backend with full CRUD functionality, input validation, and real-time updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      These enhancements helped me demonstrate my ability to write efficiently and learn how to secure and maintain code. I also learned how to organize a complete project with both frontend and backend, connect it to a database, and improve the user experience. Creating the ePortfolio allowed me to reflect on these improvements and present my work in a professional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project helped me strengthen my problem solving, communication, and technical skills. It also showed how far I have come since starting the program. I now feel confident applying for software development roles with a portfolio that shows what I can do.

  <!-- ENHANCEMENT ONE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Enhancement One – Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement focuses on improving software design and engineering principles. I refactored the original code for better structure, added features, and improved maintainability. Skills demonstrated include object-oriented design, modularization, and code documentation.

  <!-- ENHANCEMENT TWO -->
  <section>
    <h2>Enhancement Two – Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement improves algorithmic efficiency and incorporates advanced data structures. I optimized existing algorithms for performance (e.g., replaced linear search with binary search) and added complex data handling techniques, demonstrating my ability to design and implement effective computing solutions.

  <!-- ENHANCEMENT THREE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Enhancement Three – Databases</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement showcases my skills in database design and management. I added advanced querying, data migration, and integration of a full-stack solution using databases (e.g., MongoDB/MySQL). This demonstrates my competence in building data-driven applications.
