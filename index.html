    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU has helped me grow as a developer and better understand the software development lifecycle.
      Through this capstone, I created a professional ePortfolio that highlights my progress and skills, especially in full stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose to enhance a Contact Management System I previously built in CS320 Software Design and Engineering,
      replacing the original Java-based system with a full-stack React and Node.js application.
      I focused on creating a clean interface and reusable components.
      For algorithms and data structures, I added dynamic filtering and sorting, allowing users to search and organize contacts efficiently.
      For Databases, I implemented a MongoDB backend with full CRUD functionality, input validation, and real-time updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      These enhancements helped me demonstrate my ability to write efficiently and learn how to secure and maintain code.
      I also learned how to organize a complete project with both frontend and backend, connect it to a database, and improve the user experience.
      Creating the ePortfolio allowed me to reflect on these improvements and present my work in a professional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project helped me strengthen my problem solving, communication, and technical skills.
      It also showed how far I have come since starting the program.
      I now feel confident applying for software development roles with a portfolio that shows what I can do.
